coding assessment 

In this project, I have created a coding assessment quiz.  This quiz is multiple choice and has interactive challenges. 

You have 60 seconds to complete the quiz. When you answer a question right, you will gain a point, if you answer the question incorrectly, you lose 5 seconds from your time. 

I have made this quiz dynamic through JavaScript. It features only one HTML and elements that appear and disappear with the help of CSS display, and appending new elements to the page with Javascript. The quiz is also mobile responsive and adapts to the users screen size. 

This quiz also uses local storage to keep track of the user's score. The quiz then appends the user's score to the top of the page.
